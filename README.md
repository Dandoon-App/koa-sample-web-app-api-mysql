# Koa Sample App (handlebars templating + RESTful API using MySQL, on Node.js)

This is the result of a self-learning exercise on how to put together a complete Node.js
MySQL-driven [Koa](http://koajs.com) app.

When I started with Node.js (using Express), I found plenty of tutorials & examples on individual
elements, but found it hard to stitch everything together; this was even more true with Koa. Being
new to Node / Express / Koa, I found that understanding came very much by assembling *all* the
different bits together.

While the Koa ‘[hello world](http://koajs.com/#application)’ certainly doesn’t flatter to deceive,
there’s obviously a long way to go after it. This does some of that. It is a template not a
mini-tutorial. It puts a lot of the components of a complete system together: neither mini nor
tutorial!

Having worked it all out, this is now largely a ‘note-to-self’ *aide-memoire*, but I hope it might
help others in a similar situation. No one else will be doing all the same things, but seeing
components operating together may be helpful.

It is of course simplistic, but unlike many tutorials, it assembles together many of the components
of a complete system: in this case, basic interactive tools for viewing, adding, editing, and
deleting ([CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)), with *passport*
login/authentication, and a matching
[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API to do the same (using
basic access authentication). Many systems may not require an API, but the API app can be used for 
RESTful ajax functions (illustrated in the edit member/team pages). Of course, real systems do much 
more, but generally build on these core functions.

The database includes a couple of tables with related data and referential integrity – one step
beyond where most tutorials go. Hence code is included for handling basic validation and referential
integrity errors returned from the database.

Otherwise I’ve stripped it down to essentials. There’s no pretty styling! There’s no great UI. Just 
the bare building-blocks.

There are also sample integration/acceptance tests using mocha / supertest / chai / cheerio.

I don’t have time to put together a full tutorial, but I’ve tried to make everything clear & well
structured, and I’ve liberally commented the code.

## Design choices

For all that it’s rather bleeding-edge, Koa makes development far simpler than classic
callback-style Node.js with Express. *Yield* may be just a stepping-stone to ES7 *await*, but it
works. JavaScript may be looked down on ([misunderstood?](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects))
in some quarters, but I do find it vastly better to work with than PHP :)

With Node.js v4 (stable LTS) out, I believe Koa can now be 
considered[*](http://hueniverse.com/2015/03/02/the-node-version-dilemma) for production use.

The app is built with a modular approach. There are three (*composed*) sub-apps: the bare bones of a
public site, a web-based password-protected admin system using handlebars-templated html pages, and
a REST API. Each of these is structured in a modular fashion; mostly each admin module has JavaScript
handlers to handle GET and POST requests, and a set of handlebars templates; each API module has
JavaScript handlers for GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE requests.

The highly-structured applications I work on require ACID SQL databases with referential integrity,
so MongoDB was out for me. MySQL and PostgreSQL should be pretty similar, but PostgreSQL is not yet
so well supported for Koa. (Actually, one of my first Koa applications is using MongoDB/monk; there
are few changes – the models replicate monk functions, but add functionality to those functions
which update the database).

For some people, a full JavaScript framework will work better. If you’re happy to plan out your own
preferred structure, designing your own patterns means one less component to learn / conform to.

There’s always things others would do differently. If you have better ways of doing things, it will
either be down to my preferences, or my ignorance! If you notice anything I’ve got wrong or have
real improvements, let me know.

### Admin app

The admin app just does basic adding/editing/deleting. Any real app will do much more, but will
generally include and build on these basics.

I find [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) offers a good minimal-logic templates (mustache is too
limiting, but I like to work with HTML).

The main admin/app.js sets up the database connection, handlebars templating, passport
authentication, 404/500 handling, etc.

I’ve divided the app into  routes, matching handlers/controllers, and a set of templates. The 
handlers have one function for each method/route, and either render a view, redirect (e.g. after 
POST), or throw an error.

### API

The API returns JSON or XML (or plain text) according to the *Accepts* request header.

The main api/app.js sets up the database connection, content negotiation, passport authentication,
and 404/500 handling.

Routes are grouped into members, teams, team membership, and authentication. All but the simplest of
these then go on to call related handlers.

The api/members.js and api/teams.js then handle the API requests. I use PATCH in preference to PUT so
that a subset of entity fields can be supplied (correctly, a PUT will set unsupplied fields to null);
otherwise everything is very straightforward REST API, hopefully all following best practice.

### Models

Models sit above the sub-apps, as they are used by both the admin app and the API.

I use light-weight models just to manage all operations which modify stored data in the database;
individual handlers are responsible for obtaining data they require to render their templates (using
SQL queries).

### Dependencies

While very basic, this sample app incorporates together many of the components of a real application;
as well as handlebars templates & MySQL, there’s static file serving, body-parser for post data,
compression, *passport* logins with remember-me, logging, flash messages, etc, and mocha/chai/cheerio
for testing (I’ve ignored i18n which would introduce considerable complexity).

Note that if you wish to set this up locally, you will need `admin.`, `api.`, and `www.` subdomains
available. To do this, add a line such as `127.0.0.1 www.localhost api.localhost admin.localhost`
to `/etc/hosts` (on Unix/Mac), or `\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (on Windows). `npm start` 
will then make the app available at www.localhost:3000.

It uses the database set out below, with connection details as per `/config/db-development.json`.

Either Node.js v4+ or io.js is required as Node.js v0.12 doesn’t support template strings.

### Demo

There is a running version of the app at [koa-sample-app.movable-type.co.uk](http://koa-sample-app.movable-type.co.uk).

I originally structured this in a modular fashion as suggested by [TJ](https://vimeo.com/56166857), 
but I’ve since found it more convenient to work with a flatter structure (heresy!) as I found it 
unproductive to be constantly expanding and contracting folders. Go with what works for you.

The full sample app is around 1,000 lines of JavaScript.
